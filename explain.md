The `generateRandomMaze` function is like a magic spell that creates a maze (like a puzzle with paths and walls) on a piece of paper. Imagine you have a piece of paper with rows and columns, and each square on the paper can either have a wall or be open (a path). This function creates the maze by drawing walls and paths on the paper.

The function works like this:
1. You need to tell it how many rows and columns the maze should have. Think of rows as horizontal lines and columns as vertical lines on the paper.
2. You also need to give it a starting point, which is like telling the function where to begin drawing the maze on the paper.

Now, the function will start drawing the maze from the starting point and keep drawing paths and walls randomly. It will move around the paper, randomly carving paths and walls, making sure that the paths connect together to form a maze. It does this until it can't create any more paths.

As for the `tileSize`, in this function, we don't really need to use it directly. The `tileSize` is like telling the function how big each square (tile) on the paper should be. It could be useful if we were actually drawing the maze on a physical piece of paper or a canvas, but in this function, we are just creating a representation of the maze using a 2D array in JavaScript.

The 2D array acts like our paper with rows and columns, and each element in the array represents a square on the paper. We use the `0` to represent an open path and `1` to represent a wall. The actual size of each square doesn't matter for our purposes because the maze is just a digital representation stored in the 2D array.

So, in summary, the `generateRandomMaze` function creates a random maze on a piece of paper (represented as a 2D array) starting from a specific point. We don't need to worry about the `tileSize` in this function because we're not drawing the maze, just creating a digital representation of it.
